Main:
  UpdateCheck: true
  ChatUpdateCheck: true
  Notice: If ChatUpdateCheck is set to true, the player with the permission will get an update check message if available
  SQL:
    Enabled: false
    URL: localhost or your database host IP.
    Port: 3306
    Database: Database_Name
    User: username
    Pass: password
  Note: If mySQL is disabled, the plugin will user yml files instead, which may cause lag on larger servers
  Note2: A player has to log in at least once to get a log of the IP before the custom MOTD starts appearing in the server list
  Note3: If an IP has 2 or more accounts on it, it will only display the name who first joined
Custom MOTDs:
  addemod: '&5This motd will be displayed for addemod'
  playername: '&aThis motd will be shown to the player playername'
Motds:
  First MOTD: '&a&l&k.&b&l&k,&a&l&k.&a&l THE METAVERSE &a&l&k.&b&l&k,&a&l&k. &eMcMetaverse.com               &a&oNow
    1.8.1! Enjoy the new blocks!'
  Count: 1
  MOTD1: '&a&l&k.&b&l&k,&a&l&k.&a&l THE METAVERSE &a&l&k.&b&l&k,&a&l&k. &eMcMetaverse.com               &a&oNow
    1.8.1! Enjoy the new blocks!'
  Info: You can change how many MOTDs you want to use by changing the count number.
  Info2: If you only want one motd, change the count number to 1 or else it fucks up.
  Info3: To make a new motd, just continue on it like I did with MOTD3 and so on.
